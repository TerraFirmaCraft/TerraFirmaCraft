# TerraFirmaCraft

**Work in progress.**

This project is the official port of TerraFirmaCraft (the original, also called beta) to Minecraft 1.12 and beyond.

[See the website/forum for more information, a roadmap and FAQ is available there.](https://terrafirmacraft.com/) 

## Goal

- The ultimate goal of this project is to be **the** TerraFirmaCraft for 1.12.2, not a mere partial imitation.
- The idea is to stay faithful to the original where possible until at least version 1.0.
  Major content adding will probably be only done after that point.

## Contributing

+ As per the Github terms of service, you grant us the right to use your contribution
  under the same license as this project.
+ In addition we request that you give us the right to change the license in the future.
  Your pull request may not be accepted if you don't.
+ You can read the versioning rules in the build.gradle file.

### Required

+ Import & use the project's Code Style.
+ Add the proper copyright header to new files. (See below.)
+ Before you submit a PR:
    + Run the `generateResources.py` script.
    + Reformat & Rearrange your code. (IntelliJ can do this for you.)

#### Copyright header
This header should be applied to all Java source files.
Other files will be assessed on a case by case basis.
```java
/*
 * Work under Copyright. Licensed under the EUPL.
 * See the project README.md and LICENSE.txt for more information.
 */
```
Hint: Setup IntelliJ to do this automatically with a copyright profile applied 
to a shared scope matching pattern `net.dries007.tfc..*`.

### Optional

+ To enable debug logging, set your run config to include this argument: `-Dlog4j.configurationFile=../debug_log4j2_client.xml` or `_server`.
+ To auto-run the python script before every launch:
    1. Add a python run configuration (named `generateResources`) that runs the script with a python 3 interpreter with the root of the project set as run directory.
    2. In the (Java) `run client` run config, add a 'Before launch' step of type `Run another configuration` and select `generateResources` there.
    3. Move the new `run 'Python 'generateResources''` task to before the `Build` step.
    4. Done. Whenever you launch the client, it will first run the python script now. You'll see it appear in the run tab. 

## Addons

For now there is no real API, as almost none of the internal mechanics have been decided on yet.
This means that you can't really rely on anything being stable between versions.
I recommend you have narrow compatible version range string in your Forge/FML dependency string.
