# TerraFirmaCraft: The Next Generation
*TFC: TNG*

This project is the official port of TerraFirmaCraft (the original, also called classic) to Minecraft 1.12 and beyond.

You can find the mod on [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tfcraft), or stay updated by joining our [Discord](https://invite.gg/terrafirmacraft), and see documentation on the [Wiki](https://tng.terrafirmacraft.com/Main_Page).

## Goal

- The ultimate goal of this project is to be **the** TerraFirmaCraft for 1.12+, not a mere partial imitation.
- The idea is to stay faithful to the original where possible, but also improve the various systems and allow for better cross-mod compatibility and integration.
