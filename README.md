*Survival Mode As It Should've Been*

### About

TerraFirmaCraft (TFC) is a total conversion mod that overhauls and reinvents survival mode. The goal of the mod is to create a believable, challenging survival experience, in a brand new immersive setting. It completely overhauls Minecraft world generation - from adding plate tectonics, to flowing rivers, to mountain ranges, to varied and diverse forests, flora, and fauna. Below is a list of some of the features of this mod:

- The underground has been completely reimagined, with layers of different types of rock, and massive sparse ore deposits of several different types.
- A fully fledged technology tree, from pottery and pit kilns, to charcoal production, producing iron with a bloomery, steel making and more.
- Seasons, weather, and a realistic climate and calendar model cause the player to need to stockpile food for winter to survive.
- The world is alive, with many different plants, wild crops, wild fruits, animals - both passive and predators - to find
- The player must manage their food's expiration, nutrition, and thirst using our detailed food and cooking mechanics.

In order to understand all of these new features, TerraFirmaCraft comes with a detailed in-game Field Guide, which is available from the moment you spawn in, and will guide you through the art of surviving in this brand-new world.
