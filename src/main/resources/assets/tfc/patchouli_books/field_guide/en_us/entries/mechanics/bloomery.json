The iron ores are $(l:the_world/ores_and_minerals#hematite)Hematite$(), $(l:the_world/ores_and_minerals#limonite)Limonite$(), and $(l:the_world/ores_and_minerals#magnetite)Magnetite$(). These ores melt into $(thing)Cast Iron$() rather than $(thing)Wrought Iron$(). All iron-bearing items melt into Cast Iron. To turn them into usable iron, the bloomery is needed. Any iron item can be used in the bloomery, including iron tools and cast iron ingots!"
