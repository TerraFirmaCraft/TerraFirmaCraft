However, by burning at a hotter temperature they will also consume fuel faster. The bellows can provide air to a device that is directly in front of it, or in front and one block down. This allows it to provide air to a $(l:getting_started/firepit)Firepit$(), or a $(l:mechanics/charcoal_forge)Charcoal Forge$() for example."
