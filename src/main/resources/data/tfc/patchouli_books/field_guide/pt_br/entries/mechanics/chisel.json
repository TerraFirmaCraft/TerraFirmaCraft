In order to get started, you will need a $(thing)Chisel$() and any type of $(thing)Hammer$(). Chisels must be cast in molds or forged on an $(l:mechanics/anvils)Anvil$(). In order to start chiseling, hold the chisel in your main hand and a hammer in your off hand, and target a block in the world."

Change the orientation of your player and your mouse to change the orientation of the chiseled block. As a rule of thumb, the orientation of the chiseled block will be the same as if you placed it in that orientation yourself."
