During the early game, while copper is a useful metal for creating tools, the next tier of metal is one of three types of $(thing)Bronze$(). An alloy is made up of component $(thing)metals$() which must each satisfy a specific percentage of the overall whole."

The process is very similar to $(l:getting_started/finding_ores#casting)Casting$(). However, instead of using just a single metal, place enough ore pieces inside the vessel in the correct ratio to form a known alloy mix."

Each type of bronze can be used to make tools, $(l:mechanics/armor)Armor$(), and other metal items. They are slightly different so resulting tools will have different durability, efficiency, and attack damage."
