/**
 * Manager for advanced weather mechanics, that simulate local weather
 * Vanilla already handles switching rain/thunder on and off periodically
 * It then linearly interpolates between different weather events.
 *
 * Some data:
 * - Rain is for [12000, 24000] ticks on, [12000, 180000] ticks off, or 18000 on / 96000 off. P(rain) = 0.1875
 * - Thunder is for [3600, 15600] ticks on, [12000, 180000] ticks off, or 9600 on / 96000 off. P(thunder | rain) = 0.1, and P(thunder) = 0.01875
 *
 * Our model assumes that vanilla values for rain match a climate of 250mm annual rainfall - so we scale vanilla's model to rain twice as frequently - P(rain) and P(thunder | rain), and then exclude cases at < 500mm rainfall.
 *
 * We have two effects we can use to accomplish that
 * 1. Linearly scale rainfall duration compared to it's midpoint from full duration to zero. Pros: smooth interpolation. Cons: this doesn't mimic vanilla behavior at 250mm, rather it makes rain twice as common and last half as long.
 * 2. Each rainfall, assign an intensity, which only above that rainfall values will be raining. Pros: this mimics vanilla behavior w.r.t P(rain) and rain duration exactly. Cons: not smooth interpolation, rain won't appear to 'move'.
 *
 * So, we do both and average them.
