     * This event is used for lighting fires or optionally lightable blocks. If it's not cancelled, TFC will try to place a fire block.
     *
     * For things like flint and steel that don't require special mechanics, this event logic is handled for you in
     * {@link InteractionManager#setup()}. Adding items to the tag #starts_fires_with_items or #starts_fires_with_durability
     * will emulate this behavior (and allow TFC devices to be lit by your item)
     *
     * Note that the parameters of this event are the same as those expected by an item use, ie that the position, state, and direction
     * reflect what would happen if a block was clicked on. Direction refers to the face that was clicked.
