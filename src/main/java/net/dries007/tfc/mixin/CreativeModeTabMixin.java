/**
 * This is where we set the content of creative tabs, including both the icon and the display items, as non-decaying. This also affects the
 * view in JEI, as that is populated from creative tab content.
 * <p>
 * This is done as a mixin at the latest possible time for one primary reason: we want this to happen last, once creative tab content is all
 * populated, so other mods' creative tabs will also be set non-decaying. Note that for addon mods, we cannot use
 * {@link BuildCreativeModeTabContentsEvent} for this purpose, even with a listener priority set because the event will respect priority SECOND,
 * and respect mod load order FIRST, which effectively makes priority <strong>entirely useless</strong> for listening to mod bus events. Unless we
 * listen to every single mod bus which is a farce.
 * <p>
 * todo: 1.21 NeoForge, this hack solution shouldn't strictly be necessary, as mod bus events respect priority first, mod second, to confirm
