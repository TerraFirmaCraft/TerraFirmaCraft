=== Translation / Localization Tools ===

Translating the book is difficult and annoying. This allows you to translate one file, keep it up to date when the book updates, and output the entire book without changing any of the content.

In order to use, all you need to do is run

> python resources book --translate <lang>

Where <lang> is your language, i.e. en_us. This will do several things
- If a <lang>.json file does not already exist, create one
- If a <lang>.json file already exists, it will read it and use it to translate text in the book
- Finally, the <lang>.json will be updated with all text actually used by the book, and missing entries will be filled in.


=== Style Guide ===

- Entries and categories are named in easy to understand resource location IDs, matching the actual in-game name wherever possible
- The book is written, generally, in second-person as guide (i.e. using 'you' pronouns)
- It SHOULD contain all information that someone would NEED to play TFC, to a reasonable degree of competence.
- It SHOULD NOT consider itself a complete reference for every added recipe, block, item, etc. (i.e. NO 'See page 143 for all crafting recipes)
- It SHOULD be devoid of subjective opinion or other player suggestions (i.e. NO 'some people prefer to skip copper tools instead of bronze').
- It MAY contain jokes or references, as long as they do not obscure the actual meaning of things.
- It SHOULD use straightforward descriptions of particular mechanics, assuming no knowledge about TFC (i.e. YES 'In order to build a fire pit, first throw (Q) a log, and three sticks onto the ground...')
- It SHOULD NOT lock content behind any advancements unless that is specifically meant to be hidden / easter egg content
- It SHOULD use crafting recipes, images, multiblocks, and other custom page types where necessary in order to improve or better the explanations being made (i.e. NO 'In order to craft a pickaxe, place the pickaxe head on top of the stick in a crafting grid')
- It SHOULD NOT contain technical/implementation details that are either beyond the obvious, not needed in order to play the game, or intended for pack maker consumption (i.e. NO 'In order to build a fire pit, throw (Q) one log item matching the tfc:fire_pit_logs tag...')
- It SHOULD NOT document bugs, unintentional features, exploits, or ANYTHING that might be resolved at a later date (i.e. 'Dont let a glow squid escape water, or your game may crash')
- It SHOULD NOT make explicit or implicit reference to other mod or addon mechanics (i.e. 'Food preservation can be done with ... or if you have TFC Tech, with a freezer')

Other writing guides (these are enforced by resource generation):

- All entries SHOULD begin with a text() page, as Patchouli creates a standardized title page for the entry when done this way.
- All entries SHOULD have an even number of pages, as it prevents adding additional implicit empty() pages at the end of the entry.
- It MAY use page_break() to enforce that specific pages are grouped together

All the documentation on entry(), category(), all the book page functions, are copied from the Patchouli documentation, found here:
https://vazkiimods.github.io/Patchouli/docs/reference/overview

=== Dev Environment Setup ===

This enables hot reloading of book content and assets.

1. Run 'python resources book --local <.minecraft directory>' with the parameter --local set to the .minecraft/ directory of a local minecraft instance. It should say "copying into local instance at <path>"
2. Compile TFC (gradlew build) and run in this local instance
3. There will now be two books:
    /give @p patchouli:guide_book{"patchouli:book":"tfc:field_guide"}  // This is the TFC book, used by the inventory screen
    /give @p patchouli:guide_book{"patchouli:book":"patchouli:field_guide"} // This it the Patchouli namespaced book, which is hot reloadable. It is loaded from /.minecraft/patchouli_books/
4. The latter book can be hot reloaded at any time:
    4.1. Run generate_book.py with the above environment variable
    4.2. While in creative, go to the book main landing page, and shift-right-click the little pen/pencil icon.

Reloading assets - tips for creating a custom resource pack. The following command just zips up two files and places the zip in the resource pack directory, ready to be enabled:

jar -cMf "<root directory>\.minecraft\resourcepacks\book-images.zip" pack.mcmeta assets

Simply copy the /assets/tfc/textures/gui/book directory from /src/ into a different folder so you ONLY get those assets in the reloadable resource pack (makes things much faster)

=== Image Standards ===

In addition, here's some useful things for dev work, and also making standardized images:

- Images of scenery are taken in screenshots, a square section is copied and downsized to 400 x 400, and then placed in the top left corner of a 512 x 512 image
- Images of guis are taken in screenshots, then JUST THE GUI (so erase all those little pixels in the corner) is copied out. A 256 x 256 image is used, and the gui is placed horizontally centered on the FIRST 200 PIXELS (so a 176 pixel wide gui image is placed with 12 blank pixels to its left).
- Make the inventory clean, but also believable (i.e. if you were just talking about items X, Y, Z, have those items in your inventory. Don't make the inventory a focal point of the image.
- DO NOT include the book item in your inventory in screenshots! It is unobtainable in survival!
- For multiple images in the same location, i.e. to show a sort of 'animated' style, use /tp @p x y z pitch yaw to get an exact positioning before taking screenshots.
