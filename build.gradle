/**
 * Versioning rules: (Highly based on Semantic Versioning 2.0.0, https://semver.org/)
 *
 * 1. The only versions of this mod that should be in the hands of any non-contributor or
 *    special testers should be produced by the build server, and thus have a build number.
 * 2. Major version 1 is reserved for the first version deemed "a full port of TFC 1.7.10".
 *    We'll see about everything after that when/if we get there :)
 * 3. Minor versions should increase every public build with added features (that are not just bugfixes) or an API is changed.
 *    This resets when(/if) the major version is increased.
 *    This should be done when the feature is merged into the master, not before.
 * 4. The patch version should increase if a bugfix release is required. It resets every minor version.
 * 5. No special stuff is added to the version string. Ever. No exceptions.
 *    Extra information about the build can be included in the jar manifest or some other suitable source.
 *    The version number is a sacret tool that a computer must understand and be able to compare to see what's what.
 *    `-SNAPSHOT` or `.rc0v14s4dffds2` communicates nothing useful.
